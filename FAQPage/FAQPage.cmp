                                <p>There are two ways to place orders for our services:</p><br/>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">By using the Self-Service Marketplace (only for text creation, surveys and sentiment analysis)
                                    or by placing an individual order and personal contact (managed service) to our sales team</p>
                        </lightning:accordionSection>
                        <lightning:accordionSection name="B" label="Which method of ordering is best for me?">
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">In the areas of standardized text creation (with and without keywords), survey tasks and sentiment analysis, it is more advantageous and favorable for you to enter the order using the Self-Service Marketplace.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">If you have large, individual projects from any service areas offered, please contact our sales team. They will provide personal advice and discuss the project with you.</p>

                                <li>We divide the project into individual, self-contained microjobs and put them on our job platform.</li>
                                <li>The jobs are shown to, and quickly processed by the respectively qualified workers from our large network of Clickworkers.</li>
                                <li>The results are subject to a quality control. Texts are also automatically checked for plagiarisms (by copyscape) and the specified keyword density.</li>
                                <li>You will be sent the faultless results for approval.</li>
